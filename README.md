wurfl-to-plugins
================

# Description

Simple Tool for exporting elements from the Wurfl-database to plugins in e.g:

* FireFox 
* Chrome
* etc

# Note

Currently only one plugin is supported because of lazyness :-) - and we're basicly only using the UserAgentSwitcher-plugin for Firefox / Chrome
